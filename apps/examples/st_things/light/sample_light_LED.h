Several pins of JP1 can't be used as gpio:
GPIO16 & GPIO17: are not connected to the connectoer.
GPIO32 & GPIO33: are connected to XTAL 32khz.
There are several pins limited by hardware:
GPIO14 & GPIO15: are connected to SD card and pulled up to VDD33.
GPIO13: pulled up and down by both 10Kohm resistances; it is not limit.
